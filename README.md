# Code Reference

This is my knowledge base for code, where I keep notes on programming concepts and languages that I learn over time.

  It was built in React (I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)), which feels like overkill, but it was mainly so that I could learn React properly.

Have a look around.
