# Hello, world!

Here I'll write about the programming languages and techniques I've learned, so I have a convenient set of notes to refer to when I inevitably forget things.

As I learn more, I'll add more notes. The idea was to have a place I could look to quickly get back up to speed when I haven't used a language or framework in a while, but I thought these kinds of notes might be useful for others.

**These notes are by no means comprehensive, but sometimes you don't want to read a whole book before you can make something useful.** So, they can be used as a way to quickly learn the main concepts of a language or framework, and hit the ground running.
