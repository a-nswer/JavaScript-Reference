# Hello, world!

Here I'll write about the programming languages and techniques I've learned, so I have a convenient set of notes to refer to when I inevitably forget things.

As I learn more, I'll add more notes. The idea is to have a place I can look to quickly get back up to speed when I haven't used a language or framework in a while, but I think these kinds of notes can be useful for others as well, so I'll eventually make this public.

**These notes are by no means comprehensive, but sometimes you don't want to read a whole book before you can make something useful.** I've written them with the intention of providing a way to quickly learn (or relearn) the main concepts of a language or framework, and hit the ground running.
