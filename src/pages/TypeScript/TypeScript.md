# TypeScript

## What is it?

---

A quick google search will tell you that TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript. What does this mean? TypeScript is a language that basically wants to be an _extended_ version of JavaScript. Essentially, _**it's JavaScript, and then some**_.

All the JavaScript you've written is valid TypeScript, and after compilation, TypeScript just looks like normal JavaScript. This means it supports all the concepts and features of the latest version of JavaScript.

What TypeScript adds is **types**. TypeScript has (optional) static typing, as opposed to dynamic typing like normal JavaScript. If you define your code to have types, TypeScript will throw errors when the code doesn't follow those rules.

## Why do we want types?

I think a lot of people that are used to dynamic languages will come to this kind of environment and think they have lost some freedom. But having started my programming career by learning a typed language (Java), I think there are only good things that come with static type checking.

Here are some reasons to like static typing in TypeScript:

-   It's optional
-   It makes code easier to read and understand
-   It makes it easier to implement
-   It makes it easier to refactor
-   It reduces the chances of bugs, and makes it a lot harder to make silly little mistakes.
-   And all of this pretty much guarantees a more robust codebase, that will be much harder to break and much easier to maintain

Types will improve workflow and make the development process smoother and stronger, which is why TypeScript is made for the construction of large apps.
